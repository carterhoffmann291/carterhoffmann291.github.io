Alois
</h2>
<p>
 Alois was an Australian officer, during 1918 Alois was severely hurt in the trenches of Flanders. Alois was removed from the Australian prestigious cavalry school almost immediately because of his back injury that made it hard for him to bend at the waist. My favorite qutoe in the whole book is said by Alois "An old adage says that a good rider can hear his horse speak and a great rider can hear his horse whisper."

<p>Gustav Rau is a German officer who is in charge of the top secret horse breeding facility in Czechoslovakia Germany. Gustav Rau was also one of the Olympic judges that made the games rigged in favor of the German competitors so that the world would think that they are the best.
